# The Great Blog

The goal of this project is to create a modern blog layout for a fictitious Client.
The layout, hierarchy, and user experience of this blog were created without the help of any templates 
or styleguides other than those I created myself.

### Frameworks and Preprocessors Used
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4.
- LESS styling
- Flexbox
- Font Awesome Icons
- Figma for design planning. View my project file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/4Z39m7AZGsGWd5J8iJPEZL/Lifeblue-Assessment?node-id=0%3A1).

### Notable Achievements
- Fully responsive layout using Flexbox, media queries, and different style guides / HTML for different screen sizes when applicable.
- Data binding used for most text and complex component content.
- Tested on Chrome and safari, as well as varying screen sizes (mobile / tablet / web). 
- Extensive research and planning on user experience and design.
- If you look closely you will see it is [Bernie sits themed](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/bernie-sanders-meme-encapsulates-paradox-of-hero-for-young-americans-1.4471178). It felt relevant and fun.

### Room for Improvement
- Code organization / best practices
    - I chose to use Angular because I liked how I could modularize and organize my code with it. That said, I am self-taught 
    and have only been using it for ~6months, so I am sure there are organization or best practices bugs with this framework. 
    I would love nothing more than to fix all this under some great mentorship or more hands-on practice.
    - I tried to leave clarifying comments and minimize repetition in my code, but due to the timeframe of this project,
     it sometimes fell short. Could be easily fixed with a little more time and attention.
- Further code testing
    - I did not test on Firefox or other browsers than Chrome and Safari, which should absolutely happen in the future. 
- User Experience Design
    - I had a lot of fun researching and planning the UX design of this website with the ask that it is a "modern blog". 
    But the quick turn around of this project left a few pitfalls still. Ideally, I would love to have a deeper understanding 
    of client wants and potentially run usability testing on the designs.
    - I would like to further iterate and flesh out the design for the archive component, and popular-content tab controller. 
    These got the least amount of attention and could be further improved with more iterations and time.
